# JoyManager

JoyManager is a desktop application designed to manage files on Pixl.js devices over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It provides a familiar, dual-pane explorer interface for local and remote file management.

## Features

- **Dual-Pane Interface**: Browser local and device files side-by-side.
- **Recursive Upload**: Drag and drop directories to upload entire folder structures to your Pixl.js.
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select files for download or deletion with a real-time progress dialog.
- **MTU Optimized**: Conservative chunking for reliable transfers across all BLE hardware.

## Quick Start

1.  Launch **JoyManager**.
2.  Click **Connect to Device** and select your Pixl.js from the scan list.
3.  The app will automatically navigate to the first available drive (e.g., `E:/`).
4.  Drag files from your computer to the device pane to upload.
